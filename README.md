# Perudex

`Perudex` is a library implementing the game `Perudo`, also known as Dudo or Liar's Dice (which you may have heard of in the [Pirates of the Caribbean movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yUkTpzXQZc)).

The rules of the game currently implemented can be read on the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dudo) page. The game include the `Spot on` (`Calza`) variation. The `palifico` round has yet to be implemented.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `perudex` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:perudex, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/perudex](https://hexdocs.pm/perudex).

## Inspirations
This project is built around the concepts explained in the article [To spawn, or not to spawn?](https://www.theerlangelist.com/article/spawn_or_not) by Saša Jurić.
